## Ben10_obstacle_game
This is an Obstacle game based on Ben10 Alien force, a beloved cartoon of my childhood. I created this project using HTML, CSS, JS and lots of love.

The game begins with Ben Tennyson and his long-standing enemy Vilgax on the planet Anur Transyl. The Omnitrix is out of charge and Vilgax is going to attack! <br>

Pressing any key will commence the game and Vilgax will Attack. Ben can be moved with UP, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys. 1 Point is awarded for every time ben dodges Vilgax. A collision between them will result in GAME OVER!<br>
